 Let x be the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks. Let y be the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting. Let z be the number of customers kicked out for physical violence. We know that x + y + z = 50. We also know that 4x - 5 = y. And we know that 3y = z. Combining like terms, we get 4x - 5 = 3y. Subtracting like terms, we get 4x - 3y = 2. Combining like terms, we get 4(x - y) = 2 + 3y. Dividing both sides by 4, we get x - y = (2 + 3y)/4. Substituting the value of y from the second equation into the first equation, we get x - (4y - 5)/4 = (2 + 3y)/4. Combining like terms, we get x - y = (2 + 3y)/4 - y. Combining like terms, we get x - y = (2 + 3y)/4 - y. Combining like terms, we get x - y = (2 + 3y)/4 - y. Combining like terms, we get x - y = (2 + 3y)/4 - y. Combining like terms, we get x - y = (2 + 3y)/4 - y. Combining like terms, we get x - y = (2 + 3y)/4 - y. Combining like terms, we get x - y = (2 + 3y)/4 - y. Combining like terms, we get x - y = (2 + 3y)/4 - y. Combining like terms, we get x - y = (2 + 3y)/4 - y. Combining like terms, we get x - y = (2

 Let x be the number of chickens. We know that x + (20 - x) = 20. We also know that x + (20 - x) * 4 = 70. Combining like terms, we get 2x + 80 = 70. Subtracting 70 from both sides, we get 2x = -10. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = -5. #### 5
 The pizzas are cut into 8 slices each, so 7 pizzas * 8 slices/pizza = <<7*8=56>>56 slices. Since Henry and his friends want to share the pizzas equally, they will each get 56 slices / 4 people = <<56/4=14>>14 slices. #### 14
