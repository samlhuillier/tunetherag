 The phone is at 60% charged, so it has charged for 60/100 * 100 = <<60/100*100=60>>60 percentage points. The phone charges at the rate of 1 percentage-point of charge per 3 minutes, so it has charged for 60/100 * 3 = <<60/100*3=18>>18 minutes. Since 1 minute is equal to 60 seconds, the phone has charged for 18 * 60 = <<18*60=1080>>1080 seconds. Since there are 60 seconds in 1 minute, the phone will take 1080/60 = <<1080/60=18>>18 minutes to fully charge. Since 1 minute is equal to 60 seconds, 18 minutes is equal to 18 * 60 = <<18*60=1080>>1080 seconds. Therefore, it will take 1080/60 = <<1080/60=18>>18 hours to fully charge. #### 18

 First, we need to find the value of each share after the first year. We know that the stock price increased 50% the first year, so it increased from $8 to $8 * 1.50 = $<<8*1.5=12>>12. So, each share is now worth $12, so each share is worth $12 / 8 = $<<12/8=1.50>>1.50 Now we need to find the value of each share after the second year. We know that the stock price decreased 25% in the second year, so it decreased from $12 to $12 * 0.75 = $<<12*0.75=9>>9. So, each share is now worth $9 / 8 = $<<9/8=1.125>>1.125 Now we need to find the final value of all Maria's shares.

 Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, which is 5 x 3 = $<<5*3=15>>15. Rissa gave 1/2 of her money to her little sister, so she was left with 1/2 x 15 = $<<1/2*15=7.5>>7.5. Ronnie gave 1/2 of his money to his little sister, so he was left with 1/2 x 5 = $<<1/2*5=2.5>>2.5. Therefore, Rissa was left with 7.5 - 4/5 x 7.5 = $<<7.5-4/5*7.5=3>>3. Thus, Ronnie was left with 2.5 - 3 = $<<2.5-3=0.5>>0.5. #### 0.5
 Let R be the number of pints of red paint used. Let W be the number of pints of white paint used. Let P be the number of pints of purple paint used. Let Y be the number of pints of yellow paint used. We know that R + W + P + Y = 12. We also know that R = P = Y = 1/2W. Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 2W = 12 - Y. Substituting the result from the third equation into the second equation, we get 2W = 12 - 2Y. Substituting the result from the second equation into the third equation, we get 2W = 12 - 2(12 - Y). Substituting the result from the third equation into the second equation, we get 2W = 24 - 24 + 2Y. Substituting the result from the second equation into the first equation, we get 2W = 24 - 2Y. Substituting the result from the first equation into the second equation, we get 4W = 48 - 4Y. Dividing both sides by 2, we get W = 24 - 2Y / 2. Substituting the result from the last equation into the equation for W, we get W = 24 - 2(12 - Y). Substituting the result from the first equation into the second equation, we get W = 24 - 24 + 2Y. Substituting the result from the second equation into the first equation, we get W = 24 - 2Y. Dividing both sides by 2, we get W = 12 - Y. #### 12

So, team A scores 1/2 x 4 = <<1/2*4=2>>2 goals in the second half. Therefore, the total number of goals scored in the match is 4 + 2 + 2 + 4 = <<4+2+2+4=12>>12. #### 12
 On Monday, the teacher used 45% of the chalk, so he used 45/100*5= <<45/100*5=2.25>>2.25 inches of chalk. Since the teacher cannot write with a very small piece of chalk, he recycled the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches, so he recycled this piece of chalk. The teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day, so he has used 20/100*5= <<20/100*5=1>>1 inch of chalk each day. The teacher used 2.25 inches on Monday and 1 inch each day after that, so he has used 2.25+1+1+1+1+1= <<2.25+1+1+1+1+1=9>>9 inches of chalk. The teacher has 5 inches of chalk left, so he has 5-9= <<5-9=6>>6 inches of chalk left. The teacher uses 1 inch of chalk each day, so he has 6/1= <<6/1=6>>6 days left before he has to recycle this piece of chalk. #### 6

 Let s be the number of strawberry cubes, and b be the number of blueberry cubes. We know that s + b = 116, and b = 5s - 4. Substituting the second equation into the first, we get 5s - 4 + s = 116 Combining like terms, we get 5s - 4 + s = 116 Adding 4 to both sides, we get 5s - 4 + s + 4 = 120 Subtracting s from both sides, we get 5s - 4 = 116 Adding 4 to both sides, we get 5s = 120 Dividing both sides by 5, we get s = 24 Substituting this value for s back into the equation, we get 24 = 120 #### 24
