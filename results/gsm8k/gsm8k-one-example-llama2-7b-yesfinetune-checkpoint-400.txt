$13 - $1.5 = $<<13-1.5=11.5>>11.5 is the original price of a tub of ice cream. There is a $1.5 discount on each $1.5 = $<<1.5=1.5>>1.5. So, a tub of ice cream is now sold at $11.5 - $1.5 = $<<11.5-1.5=9.5>>9.5. The original price of a packet of milk is $2. So, there is a $2 - $0.5 = $<<2-0.5=1.5>>1.5 discount on each $2. Therefore, a packet of milk is now sold at $2 - $1.5 = $<<2-1.5=0.5>>0.5. Thus, the two tubs of ice cream amount to $9.5 x 2 = $<<9.5*2=19>>19. The four packets of milk amount to $0.5 x 4 = $<<0.5*4=2>>2. Therefore, you will save $19 - $2 = $<<19-2=17>>17 if you buy 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk. #### 17

 First, we need to determine how many spots she moved forward. We do this by subtracting the number of spots she fell back from the number of spots she jumped ahead: 5 spots - 2 spots = <<5-2=3>>3 spots. Next, we need to find the number of spots she fell back. We do this by adding the number of spots she moved forward to the number of spots she fell back: 3 spots + 5 spots = <<3+5=8>>8 spots. Finally, we divide the number of spots she fell back by the number of spots per lap to find the number of laps she fell back on: 8 spots / 100 meters/lap = <<8/100=0.08>>0.08 laps. Since 1 lap is 100 meters, this means she fell back 0.08 laps x 100 meters/lap = <<0.08*100=8>>8 meters. We then add this to the distance she ran in the first lap to find the total distance she ran: 8 meters + 100 meters = <<8+100=108>>108 meters. We then subtract this distance from the total distance she ran to find the distance she ran in the last lap: 108 meters - 8 meters = <<108-8=100>>100 meters. Since 1 lap is 100 meters, this means she ran 100 meters in the last lap. Since there are 100 meters per lap, this means she ran 1 lap. Since 100 meters is equal to 1 lap, this means she finished 100 meters - 1 lap = <<100-1=99>>99 meters ahead of last place. We then divide this number by the number of places in the race to find the number of places she placed: 99
6 decks have 6 decks x 25 cards = <<6*25=150>>150 cards. 5 boxes have 5 boxes x 40 cards = <<5*40=200>>200 cards. Miss Maria has a total of 150 + 200 cards = <<150+200=350>>350 cards.

oats can be fed twice a day, so each horse can eat 5 pounds of oats x 2 meals = <<5*2=10>>10 pounds of oats per day. Therefore, four horses can consume 10 pounds of oats/horse x 4 horses = <<10*4=40>>40 pounds of oats in one day. Five days require 5 days x 2 meals per day = <<5*2=10>>10 meals. So, Uncle Ben needs 40 pounds of oats/meal x 10 meals = <<40*10=400>>400 pounds of oats for five days. Thus, he needs 400 pounds of oats/50 pounds of oats per bag = <<400/50=8>>8 bags of oats. #### 8

 Gerald and Julia divided the money in the ratio 3:2, so the total of the ratios is 3+2=<<3+2=5>>5. Since the ratio is 3:2, the share of Julia is 2/5, and the share of Gerald is 3/5. If they had $100, and the share of Julia is 2/5, then she had 2/5*100 = $<<2/5*100=40>>40. The total money spent by Julia is $40, and since she got 2/5 of the total money, then the total money left is $100-$40 = $<<100-40=60>>60. Since Gerald got 3/5 of the total money, then he got 3/5*100 = $<<3/5*100=120>>120. The total money spent by Gerald is $120, and since he spent some money, then the total money left is $60+$120 = $<<60+120=180>>180. If Gerald spent $10 on a book, then he has $180-$10 = $<<180-10=170>>170 left. #### 170

 Let X be the number of flights to France. If the first plane flies to France and Germany for X/2 flights, and to Greece for (X/2)+X/2=3/2X/2=3X/4 flights, then the total number of flights the first plane makes in one day is 3X/4+X/2=7X/4. If the other plane flies exclusively to Poland, then it flies 44/2=<<44/2=22>>22 flights in one day. The total number of flights the two planes make in one day is 7X/4+22=100-44=56 flights. If the first plane flies to France for X flights, then the total number of flights it makes in one day is 56+X=7X/4. If the first plane flies to France and Germany for X/2 flights, then the total number of flights it makes in one day is 56+X/2=7X/4. If the first plane flies to France and Germany for X flights, then the total number of flights it makes in one day is 56+X=7X/4. If the first plane flies to France and Germany for X/2 flights, then the total number of flights it makes in one day is 56+X=7X/4. Therefore, if the first plane flies to France, Germany, and Greece for X/2, X, and X/2 flights respectively, then it flies to France for X/2=X/4=X/2=<<3/4=1.5>>1.5 flights. If the first plane flies to France, Germany, and Greece for X/2, X, and X/2 flights respectively, then it flies to France for X=3X/4=3X/2=<<3*4=12>>1

 If he is traveling at an average speed of 50km/hr, and he is traveling for 3 days, then he will have gone 50km/hr * 3 days = <<50*3=150>>150km of distance. If the distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000km, then after 3 days, he will have gone 6000km - 150km = <<6000-150=5850>>5850km remaining distance. If he has traveled 150km in 3 days, then this means that he has traveled at a rate of 150km / 3 days = <<150/3=50>>50km/day. If the distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000km, then he has only traveled 50km/day * 5 days = <<50*5=250>>250km of the distance. Since 6000km is the total distance, and he has traveled 250km, this means he has only traveled 6000km - 250km = <<6000-250=5750>>5750km of the distance.

 If the animals have a total of 70 legs, then each animal has 70 / 20 = <<70/20=3.5>>3.5 legs. Since the animals are either chickens or cows, this means that the cows have 20 - 3 = <<20-3=17>>17 legs. So if the animals have 3.5 legs each, then the chickens have 3.5 legs each x 20 chickens = <<3.5*20=70>>70 legs. This means that the cows have 70 legs - 17 cows = <<70-17=53>>53 legs. Since the animals have a total of 70 legs, then the cows have 70 legs - 53 legs = <<70-53=17>>17 legs. Since the cows have 17 legs, then the chickens have 70 legs - 17 cows = <<70-17=53>>53 legs. This means that there are 53 legs / 2 = <<53/2=26>>26 chickens. #### 26
